                        Our project is aims to build the ground work for Kinect integration
                        into the Cross Reality Collaboration Sandbox. We are working to build
                        a set of intuitive controls and systems that will allow users to jump
                        right in and start interacting within the digital space.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Kinect offers a unique challenge in creating a user interaction that is
                        intuitive and easy to use. When a user enters the Kinect Camera space, a
                        Skelton is generated for the user that accurately tracks hand and head within
                        the 3D space. The limitation comes from the user not being able to leave the
                        camera space, so all user interactions are limited to the field of view of the
                        Kinect. The user interface for the project was designed with this in mind and
                        allows the user to complete more complex tasks using a gesture controls. A
                        cursor is mapped to each hand and detects when the user closes their hand as
                        interaction point with the Interface. Future user interfaces will be able to
                        use this as a guideline for designing the way they want the user to interact
                        with the system. In the future, we would like the system to support voice
                        controls and full body gesture recognition
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another limitation presented by the Kinect is that it lacks the ability to
                        navigate around larger environment. A positional UI was designed around this
                        idea and what we had designed with the user interface gesture controls. The
                        Positional UI offers 3 unique camera perspectives that show the world from
                        above, in front of, and to the side of the user. From here the user can grab
                        themselves, the camera, or the environment and move it relative to the hand
                        movement. If the user grabs themselves or the camera and them grabs the
                        environment with the other hand, they are able to rotate the object relative
                        to the movement of the hand. Last interaction is the user is able to zoom
                        in and out by grabbing the environment with both hands similar to a pinch
                        zoom feature you find on smart phones
