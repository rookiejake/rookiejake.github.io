                    <h4>Abstract</h4>
                    <p>As the number of augmented and virtual reality devices on the market grows, so too does the
                        potential for meaningful collaboration among users of different platforms. The potential for
                        meaningful collaboration among personal computer (PC), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality
                        (AR), and mixed reality (MR) users creates an unmet need for applications that provide
                        interaction among them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To meet the need, an application was developed using the Unity
                        game engine that provides collaboration between PC, VR, and MR
                        users with a mobile robot in a scanned three-dimensional (3D) environment. The development
                        resulted in a collaborative environment and increased knowledge of both how to create more
                        attractive 3D environments from images and localize a mobile robotâ€™s
                        position within the virtual environment.
