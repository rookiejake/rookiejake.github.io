                        different locations into the same space using multiple
                        Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality devices.

                        Convergent’s Ultra Reality Space offers a new way of
                        communication and resource sharing, helping clients to
                        communicate more realistically regardless of physical location
                        through VR in one shared space. Ultra Reality Space uses an
                        Azure-hosted server that synchronizes user interactions and
                        stores necessary data for a virtual environment.
