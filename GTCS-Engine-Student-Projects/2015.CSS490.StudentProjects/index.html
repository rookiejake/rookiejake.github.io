<h2><b>Fall 2015 CSS490: Game Engine Development. Final Games</b></h2>

These are the final games we build during the last three weeks of class in Fall Quarter 2015, as ways to demonstrate 
	the features of the
	<a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/ksung/2DGameEngine/BookChapters/AllExamples.html">
	GTCS game engine </a>we have learned to build in this class. 
	<p><strong><span class="auto-style1">NOTE</span>: </strong>You should run 
	the games using the<strong> <span class="auto-style2">Chrome web browser</span>.
	</strong>Explore 11 does not support AudioContext and Mozilla Firefox (v 
	39.0) does not support GLSL shaders and thus will not allow the games to 
	run.</p>

        <p>Explore the ocean floor as a monkey scuba diver and look for bananas! Watch out for angry fish and collect oxygen bubbles at the very least if you want to survive. Just 
  kidding, the game is actually infinite and you have to die eventually. But it is better to die with your pockets full of bananas, so get out there and go get some!</p>

				<p>Cave escape is an action side-scrolling shooter where the player must survive a turret-infested cave. The objective of the game is to reach the end of the cave by going through four stages. Each stage is marked by a certain distance that the ship travels, and the player wins by making it to the end of the final stage and escaping the cave.</p>
				<p>The player must make use of the ships weapons to destroy the turrets which endanger the ship from reaching its goal. Along the way, there are many powerups that the player can obtain to aid in the fight against the turrets. The player must be careful to navigate the cave and avoid crashing into any of the walls. The ship's light will help the player see in the darkness, but the light diminishes as the player takes damage and loses energy. The ship can be repaired and refueled by picking up certain powerups, and its weapons can be enhanced as well. Can you defeat the turrets and escape the cave?</p>

			Carrier Assault is based off of a battleship-style game. You must control the aircraft carrier and its aircrafts to maneuver around land and sea and try to defeat enemy turrets.
