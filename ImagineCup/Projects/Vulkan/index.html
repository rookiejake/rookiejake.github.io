                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                    <p>Computer Graphics is about the creation and manipulation of digital visual content. It supports
                        applications in fields such as computational biology, physics, simulation, designing, video
                        games, etc. Vulkan is a high-performance, cross-platform 3D graphics API designed for modern
                        GPU pipeline. It follows an object-based API concept with graphics state information being
                        localised to a command buffer [1]. Vulkan is an explicit API. That is, almost everything is the
                        programmer’s responsibility. This is in contrast to the older APIs such as OpenGL where system
                        drivers would track the state of many objects, manage memory and synchronization, and check for
                        errors in the application as it ran. While the older system provides convenience for the
                        developers, it also generate significant overhead for the CPU [2]. Vulkan addresses this by
                        placing the responsibilities of almost all state tracking, synchronization, and memory
                        management into the hands of the application developer. This approach is more efficient where
                        the driver does not have to perform tasks behind the scenes to manage resources. As a result,
                        system job processing is streamlined, and straightforward, resulting in optimal performance and
                        predictable behavior [3]. </p>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, the added responsibilities and the associated the sophistication in the
                        underlying architecture mean that the Vulkan API can be a significant hurdle for new users.
                        This is especially challenging as it is a fairly new API with no significant community help.
                    </p>
