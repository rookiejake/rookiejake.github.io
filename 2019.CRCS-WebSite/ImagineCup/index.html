                        Convergent’s Ultra Reality Space offers a new way of
                        communication and resource sharing, helping clients to
                        communicate more realistically regardless of physical location
                        through VR in one shared space. Ultra Reality Space uses an
                        Azure-hosted server that synchronizes user interactions and
                        stores necessary data for a virtual environment.

                        The competition was held April 19-20 in Seattle. They also
                        had an exhibition at Seattle Art Museum (SAM)  to showcase
                        their project to public.
