                        Recent advances in technology enabled a new generation of Augmented Reality
                        (AR) development where the near seamless integration and interaction
                        between computer generated virtual and real-world physical objects can be
                        achieved in real-time. This maturation of AR technology resulted in
                        consumer-level commercial AR products. This products support user
                        mobility in the physical world in two ways: the AR head mounted solution
                        in the Microsoft HoloLens, and the handheld mobile device solution in
                        the Google Tango. The head mounted solution has two main advantages: the
                        immersive experience with stereoscopic display, and hands-free interaction
                        with the AR world.

                        The HoloLens supports object manipulation with Natural User Interface (NUI),
                        with the inherent NUI shortcomings of lacking in precision and intuition.
                        This project investigates approaches to remedy these shortcomings by
                        integrating other user interface paradigms. The availability of user’s free
                        hands and the limited display real-estate of the head mounted display
                        suggested exploration of solutions based on Tangible User Interface (TUI)
                        devices that can support the display of Graphical User Interface (GUI)
                        widgets. This thesis explores the potentials of linking a popular mobile
                        phone as a TUI device for HoloLens, designs GUI for the phone display,
                        adopts results from related user interaction research, and implements a
                        novel solution to overcome the HoloLens UI shortcomings. Results from user
                        testing shows the novel approach supports a faster object manipulation in
                        general, object size adjustments in particular, and a more efficient and
                        effective object manipulation experience.
