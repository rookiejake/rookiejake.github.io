                    <h4>Abstract</h4>
                    <p>Advances in computing hardware and the introduction of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) have
                        empowered computer graphics in many fields, including the movie and video game industries.
                        These advances have led to the widespread use of complex and realistic special effects such as
                        explosions, fire, smoke, rain, fog, dust, shafts of light or shadow, and others. While many
                        public displays of these effects in use exist, the details of their illumination modeling and
                        implementations are often protected as trade secrets. This is especially true in the video game
                        industry, where the difference between being a leader or just another competitor in the large
                        sea of companies and independents can come down to the small quality achievements one company’s
                        product has over its competitors. </p>

                    <p>
                        The focus of this project is the understanding and implementation of one volumetric effect,
                        fog. Our project has three goals. The first goal is to build an understanding of the
                        illumination model of fog in general and how this effect can be approximated and created in
                        modern imagery using a GPU. The second goal is to demonstrate our understanding by implementing
                        an interactive system where these effects can be interacted with and examined. Our third goal
                        is to provide a starting point for future researchers and enthusiasts by sharing both the
                        lessons we have learned and the resources we have developed during this project.
