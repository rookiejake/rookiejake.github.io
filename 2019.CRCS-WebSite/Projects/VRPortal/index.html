                    <h4>Abstract</h4>
                    <p>This project seeks to explore the concept of portals, and how they can be applied in a
                        networked, VR/AR context. The resulting portal system was developed using Unity and the
                        Augmented Space Library (ASL) as a base, and extends the concept of portals beyond simply
                        connecting two virtual spaces.</p>
                    <p>The resulting portal system provides a flexible framework for creating a portal with any mixture
                        of space and view types, such as a virtual space with a virtual view, a virtual space with a
                        physical &nbsp;view, or even potentially a physical space with a physical view.</p>
                    <p>With this system, a virtual space/physical view portal was created. This was accomplished with
                        the aid of a web camera and 3D scans of a room created using a Tango phone. In this case, the
                        web camera was used to display a live feed of a room on a portal surface, and upon entering the
                        portal, the user would be presented with a 3D model that matches the camera live feed.</p>

                    <h4>Objectives</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Develop a system in Unity that Uses ASL to create portals</li>
                        <li>
                            This system will allow users to
                            <ul>
                                <li>Create portals at-will</li>
                                <li>Dynamically set portal destinations</li>
                                <li>Seamlessly view a space on one end of the portal from the other end</li>
                                <li>
                                    Seamlessly view and travel between two spaces:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Virtual to Virtual</li>
                                        <li>Virtual to Mixed</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Share portals with other, networked users</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>The portal system shall be well documented for future students to use</li>
                        <li>The portal system shall be extensible for use in more portal scenarios (i.e. Virtual to
                            Physical)</li>
                    </ul>
