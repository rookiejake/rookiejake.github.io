                        Touching Augmented Reality: Direct Object Manipulation for Marker-less AR on Handheld Devices

                        Supporting augmented reality (AR) on handheld mobile devices is interesting due
                        to the low costs, low power consumptions, portability, and mobility. Until
                        recently, AR has been accomplished on handheld devices through the aid of
                        distinguishable visual markers in which computer generated virtual objects
                        display over these visual markers, this is referred to as marker AR. A major
                        restriction with marker AR is that an entire visual marker must be visible
                        through a camera of a handheld device at all times. Recent advancements in
                        technology has overcome this limitation, and mobile devices now support
                        marker-less AR on handheld devices where visual makers are no-longer required.
                        While there are significant work done and results available in addressing
                        virtual object manipulation with marker AR, it is unclear how these findings
                        will apply in marker-less AR applications. With marker-less AR technology on
                        mobile devices being a recent development, there currently is a lack of
                        results addressing virtual object manipulations in marker-less AR settings.

                        The goals of this study are to analyze the distinct differences of virtual
                        object manipulation in marker AR and marker-less AR, understand the
                        implications of these differences, observe the results of these differences
                        in actual user tests to identify trends and interesting observations, identify
                        relevant results from marker AR virtual object manipulations to predict and
                        verify the subset of marker AR object manipulation methods that can transition
                        into marker-less AR. This study conducts user testing on five implemented
                        virtual object manipulation methods. Four methods are the latest results from
                        marker AR research on handheld devices, while a fifth method is a proposed
                        novel method attempting to address the distinctions between the two AR
                        settings. User testing of these methods shows no single method applies well
                        in all marker-less AR test cases where the requirements of manipulating small
                        scale objects are  distinct, and orthogonal from those of interacting with
                        relatively large objects. The gathered results suggests that for mark-less AR
                        applications, methods for virtual object manipulations should be adaptive to
                        the relative sizes of the target AR objects.
