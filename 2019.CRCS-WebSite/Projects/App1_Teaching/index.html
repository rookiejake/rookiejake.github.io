                        Building collaborative tools, a cohesive AR/VR experience,
                        and a procedural API for use in teaching programming to kids
                        with VR collaboration as a driving motivator.

                        Teaching middle school kids programming is an ambitious
                        task. Several factors complicated their learning beyond a
                        standard student of computer science, one of which lies in
                        proper motivation. We hope to alleviate this by
                        incorporating VR/AR into their learning, and allowing
                        for students to collaborate with one another in a virtual world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Teaching materials for this project are being constructed
                        for use at the Pacific Science Center at a summer VR
                        "boot camp". Kids will learn the basic fundamentals of
                        programming: syntax, if statements, for loops.. while
                        they construct their own games or experiences that they
                        and their classmates may experience in VR/AR.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Students will be able to experience their virtual worlds
                        with an HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, or Google Tango capable
                        phone. Tools built in this project utilize the networked
                        capability of the CRCS to allow students to experience
                        virtual worlds together, using multiple devices, or just
                        on their development environments, allowing a lot of
                        flexibility for teaching and learning.
