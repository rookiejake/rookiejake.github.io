                        In order to make the Cross Reality Collaboration Sandbox (CRCS) available
                        to more people, we needed to make it more accessible by more people. We
                        decided to look at mobile devices, as these are carried everyday by large
                        numbers of people. These devices are a great way to communicate with
                        people around the world, and contain a number of different built-in
                        sensors that can be used in an Augmented Reality setting such as CRCS.

                        This project aims at exploring these sensors on Android devices, and creating
                        a simple game to demonstrate these functionalities. The game itself is a
                        first person game in which the objective is to fire fruit at other players
                        in order to be the last one standing.  It is designed to hold as many players
                        as possible and using Photon Unity Network (PUN) to store individual data
                        about each user connect to the master client.
